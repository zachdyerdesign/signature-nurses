### What does temporary staffing mean?

When you need to temporarily increase the size of your healthcare staff and expand your workforce, temporary medical staffing is the perfect solution! This can be a result of employee absences, census fluctuations, seasonal workloads and special projects. Depending on your facility's need, a temporary assignment can last a day, a week, a month, several months, or perhaps even longer. It can also be the perfect solution to a particularly difficult shift you need to cover regularly. {{ site.title }} works as your staffing partner to provide you with who you want, when you want them. Scheduling is our specialty and we work with you to take care of your residents and patients.
